#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Tests for the steps of action.yml that read a caller's input: how the commands, the test
# arguments, the report path, the merge-base and the gate thresholds reach the tools they
# drive. Plain bash, no framework:
#   tests/input-steps.test.sh
# Exits non-zero if any case fails.
#
# The runner used to replace each `${{ inputs.* }}` in these scripts with its value before
# the shell parsed them, so a value that held shell syntax ran as shell (#39). Each step now
# reads its values from environment variables its `env:` block fills. This runs every such
# step as the runner would, with the variables set by the case, against stub `cargo`, `git`,
# `patchcov` and `sudo` that log their arguments, and asserts what the tools were asked to
# do. The scripts are read out of action.yml itself, so renaming a step or moving its
# `run:` block fails here, by name, rather than leaving a test of a copy. The steps with
# their own tests (platform, guard, resolve-version) are not repeated here.
#
# What it pins that a plain run cannot show: that a value holding quotes, `$`, backticks,
# spaces or a `;` reaches a tool as the one argument it was (and never runs), that
# `test-args` and `worktree-system-deps` are split on whitespace and refuse what used to be
# shell, that the two command inputs are still shell (one shell, `-e`, the instrumentation
# env), and that the action's own variables are not left in the environment of the code a
# caller owns. Hostile values carry a canary: a command that would create a file under
# $WORK, and every case asserts the file is absent.

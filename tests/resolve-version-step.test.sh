# Tests for the "Resolve patchcov version" step of action.yml. Plain bash, no
# framework:
#   tests/resolve-version-step.test.sh
# Exits non-zero if any case fails.
#
# The step resolves `version: latest` with one GitHub API call. Run unauthenticated
# from a shared runner IP that call hit the 60/hr limit and failed the whole job (#1),
# so it now sends the token and tries three times. This pins that: the header, the
# retries and their delays, what is retried and what is not (a 401, 403 or 429 is an
# answer retrying cannot change and goes straight to the redirect, #62), the timeouts
# that let a hung connection be retried, a
# runner with no jq (which skips the API and asks the redirect, #63), and that a pinned version never touches the network and loses a
# leading v (#38) or V, and that one with nothing left after it, or empty, fails with a
# message instead (#51). A spent limit can outlast those attempts, so when all three fail the
# step reads the tag from the github.com releases/latest redirect instead (#40). This
# pins that too: the one request it makes, that only a release tag of patchcov's own is
# taken from it, and the one error that names both failures when neither answers. The
# step's script is read out of action.yml itself, so renaming the step or moving its
# `run:` fails here, by name, rather than leaving a test of a copy. The script reads the
# version and the token from environment variables its `env:` block fills (nothing is
# substituted into the script text), so a case sets those, and the wiring cases at the
# end check that `env:` fills them.
#
# `curl` is a stub that replays the responses a case scripts, one per call, and logs
# each call's arguments; `sleep` is a stub that logs its argument and returns, so no
# case touches the network or waits. `jq` is the real one, as on the runner. A response
# may start with `@<status>@` to give the HTTP status the API call's `-w` asks for (200
# without it); the redirect call gets its scripted answer as it is.

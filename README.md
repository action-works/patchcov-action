# Patchcov Coverage Check Action

A GitHub Action that runs code-coverage analysis and posts a diff/patch-coverage pull-request comment using [patchcov](https://github.com/rust-works/patchcov).

The coverage analysis uses [patchcov](https://github.com/rust-works/patchcov); the Rust coverage run uses cargo-llvm-cov. The repository name remains `omni-dev-coverage-check`.

## Migrating from v1 to v2

v2 switches from `omni-dev coverage diff` to `patchcov diff`. Update the action reference
to `action-works/omni-dev-coverage-check@v2`. The repository name stays the same.

- Replace any omni-dev `version` pin with a patchcov version, such as `0.4.0`, or omit
  it to use the pinned default. Explicit `latest` is still supported.
- Rename output references from `omni-dev-cache-hit` to `patchcov-cache-hit`.
  The existing `version` and `release-tag` outputs now describe patchcov.
- Move `.omni-dev/coverage.yaml` to `.patchcov/config.yaml`, preserving the coverage
  settings, and replace `OMNI_DEV_CONFIG_DIR` with `PATCHCOV_CONFIG_DIR` if set.
- Replace source markers such as `omni-dev: coverage ignore` and
  `omni-dev: coverage tolerate` with the introducer `patchcov:` followed by
  `coverage ignore` or `coverage tolerate`. Run `patchcov lint-markers` to check them.

Patchcov ignores the old configuration, environment variable and markers. Without
migration, exclusions may disappear and measured coverage may change. The action warns
when it detects these legacy settings or markers in tracked source files; it does not
convert them. Keep `.omni-dev/` settings used by other omni-dev commands.

## Migrating to the patchcov 0.4.0 default

The action now installs patchcov 0.4.0 by default. A nonempty head, shard or
baseline report whose paths match no tracked file fails with exit code 7. On a
pull request, this stops the Build coverage diff step before the comment posts.
Correct `strip-prefix` so report paths resolve to tracked files in the checkout.
If accepting unmatched paths is intentional, commit this native configuration
in `.patchcov/config.yaml`:

```yaml
diff:
  allow-path-mismatch: true
```

Patchcov reads this configuration from the checkout when the action runs. The
opt-out applies to path mismatch; other report errors still fail.

Coverage gates still exit 1. Other failures now have distinct exit codes:
2 (usage), 3 (report), 4 (marker), 5 (config), 6 (git), 7 (path mismatch), and
8 (other). Caller scripts should test for a nonzero status rather than only 1.
An explicit `version: '0.1.1'` retains the previous release's behavior.

## Features

- Cached, version-pinnable `patchcov` binary (same key scheme as commit-check)
- **Fat mode (default)**: runs `cargo-llvm-cov` for you and produces the report
- **Thin mode**: bring your own lcov; the action only diffs, comments, and gates
- **Sharded runs**: split the instrumented run across concurrent jobs, then combine the
  shard reports in one aggregation job and keep the comment, baseline, and gates
- Merge-base baseline, falling back to the nearest ancestor's baseline and then to a
  git-worktree recompute
- Sticky pull-request comment with patch coverage, per-file deltas, and the
  uncovered `file:line` list (via `patchcov diff`)
- Full per-file summary appended to the run's Summary tab and uploaded as an artifact
- Overall line-coverage and patch-coverage gates (run *after* the comment posts)
- Optional codecov.io upload

## Quick Start

A drop-in coverage job for a Rust workspace:

```yaml
name: Coverage
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write        # required to post the coverage comment
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0          # full history so `git merge-base` resolves the fork point

      - uses: action-works/omni-dev-coverage-check@v2
```

That single step installs `patchcov`, runs `cargo-llvm-cov`, posts the PR comment, publishes the baseline on `main`, and enforces `--fail-under-lines 30`.

## Modes

### Fat mode (default)

`run-coverage: true` (the default) makes the action run the whole `cargo-llvm-cov`
pipeline itself — exactly like a hand-rolled coverage job. You only check out the
repo with `fetch-depth: 0`; the action handles the toolchain, `cargo-llvm-cov`
install, instrumented test run, report generation, baseline, comment, and gates.

The instrumented run's raw profiles (`*.profraw`) are merged **once**, however many
outputs are produced. `cargo llvm-cov report` merges every raw profile each time it is
called, which costs minutes per call for a suite that spawns many processes and leaves
thousands of them. The action merges them with the first report (the lcov), removes the
raw profiles, and lets the `codecov.json`, summary and line-gate calls read the merged
profile. The outputs are unchanged. Once the action has run, the target directory
that `cargo llvm-cov show-env` reports (the action's steps run under it) holds the
merged profile (`<workspace-name>.profdata`) and no `*.profraw`. If a step of yours
then runs more instrumented tests under the same `show-env` and calls `cargo llvm-cov
report`, that report covers only those new runs, because this run's raw profiles are
gone.

### Thin mode

`run-coverage: false` skips `cargo-llvm-cov` entirely. Produce the per-line lcov
yourself (any tool, any language) and point `report` at it; the action runs
`patchcov diff`, posts the comment, and applies `--fail-under-patch` and
`--fail-under-lines`. The worktree baseline fallback is `cargo-llvm-cov`-specific
and is skipped in this mode, so a baseline-download miss means a comment without
deltas.

The thin-mode line gate reads the lcov itself (`patchcov diff
--fail-under-lines`) rather than `cargo llvm-cov report`, so its figure can differ
slightly from llvm-cov's own summary: on patchcov's own suite (about 97% covered)
it ran 0.16 percentage points higher. It also needs an patchcov release that has
the flag; the action stops with that message if the installed one does not. Set
`fail-under-lines: ''` to run thin mode without a line gate.

```yaml
- run: |
    # produce coverage-head.lcov however you like
    cargo llvm-cov --all-features --workspace --lcov --output-path coverage-head.lcov

- uses: action-works/omni-dev-coverage-check@v2
  with:
    run-coverage: false
    report: coverage-head.lcov
    fail-under-patch: 80
```

### Sharded runs (thin mode)

When the instrumented test run is too slow for one job, split it across a matrix of
shard jobs and combine their lcov reports in one aggregation job. The aggregation
job keeps everything a single job gave you: the PR comment, the baseline publish on
`main`, the patch gate, and the overall line gate.

```yaml
jobs:
  shard:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false              # a failed shard must still fail the aggregation job, not hide it
      matrix:
        shard: [1, 2, 3]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
        with:
          components: llvm-tools-preview
      - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
      - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
        with:
          tool: cargo-llvm-cov,cargo-nextest
      # `cargo test` cannot partition; nextest can.
      - run: >-
          cargo llvm-cov nextest --all-features --workspace
          --partition count:${{ matrix.shard }}/3
          --lcov --output-path shard-${{ matrix.shard }}.lcov
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
        with:
          name: coverage-shard-${{ matrix.shard }}
          path: shard-${{ matrix.shard }}.lcov

  coverage:
    needs: shard                    # not `if: always()`: a failed shard fails this job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v8
        with:
          pattern: coverage-shard-*
          merge-multiple: true      # every shard file lands in one directory
          path: shards
      - uses: action-works/omni-dev-coverage-check@v2
        with:
          run-coverage: false
          shard-reports: shards/shard-*.lcov
          fail-under-lines: 70
          fail-under-patch: 80
```

The same topology (a shard matrix, `merge-multiple`, one aggregation job) runs end to
end on real runners in this repository: see
[`.github/workflows/e2e-sharded.yml`](.github/workflows/e2e-sharded.yml).

`shard-reports` takes paths or globs, one per line. The action checks each shard,
joins them into `report` (default `coverage-head.lcov`), and every later step reads
that one file, exactly as if a single job had produced it. A shard that is missing
(a glob that matches nothing, or a path that does not exist), empty, or without any
line records fails the run **by name**, so a failed shard cannot quietly lower
coverage. A shard whose absolute paths all fall outside the workspace root draws a
warning.

Things to know:

- **Partitioning needs nextest**, which the action never runs for you: the shard job
  and its `--partition count:N/M` are yours (see [Why there is no `mode: shard`](#why-there-is-no-mode-shard)).
  nextest does not run doctests, so coverage that only a doctest provides is lost
  unless you add the [doctest job](#recovering-doctest-coverage) below.
- **`setup-commands` and `extra-test-commands` are fat-mode inputs**, so a sharded
  run does that work itself, in the job that needs it. Setup that tests need (a model
  download, say) goes in each shard job that runs them. Work that should run exactly
  once rather than per shard, such as a gated `--ignored` suite, gets a job of its
  own, like the doctest job below. Three rules for such a job:
  - Name its artifact and file so the aggregation job's `pattern` and `shard-reports`
    globs match them (`coverage-shard-*` and `shard-*.lcov` above). A report the globs
    miss is not an error, because the other shards still match: coverage just drops.
  - Run it on every event the shard jobs run on. If it is skipped on pull requests
    (secrets missing on forks, say), the head report lacks lines the `main` baseline
    has, and the comment shows a drop that no change caused.
  - Run it under the same workspace root as the shards (next bullet).

  Anything nextest can partition just takes its flags on the partitioned run
  (`--run-ignored all` adds the ignored tests to a partitioned run).
- **Every shard must run under the same workspace root** (the same runner image
  does), because the report paths are made repo-relative by stripping one prefix.
  Use `strip-prefix` if the root is not the checkout directory.
- **The shards are merged as lcov.** The merge is a union: a line any shard covered is
  covered. It does not sum hit counts, which nothing in the line output reads.
- **A sharded total is not bit-identical to an unsharded one** when tests depend on
  timing or process-global state; on patchcov's suite 38 of 324,274 lines differed.
- **`strip-prefix`, `report-format`, and the baseline are as in thin mode.**
  `report-format`, if set, must be `lcov`. The baseline published on `main` is the
  combined file.
- With `codecov: true` in thin mode, the action uploads the shard files themselves
  (codecov merges several uploads natively) and, outside sharded runs, the lcov at
  `report`, since there is no `codecov.json`.

#### Recovering doctest coverage

Add one job that runs only the doctests and uploads its own report. The join takes
any number of files, so the `coverage-shard-*` and `shards/shard-*.lcov` patterns above
pick it up unchanged; the only edit to the aggregation job is `needs: [shard, doctests]`.

```yaml
  doctests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v7
      # `cargo llvm-cov --doc` is unstable, so this job needs nightly.
      - uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@nightly
        with:
          components: llvm-tools-preview   # without it cargo-llvm-cov stops at an install prompt
      - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2
      - uses: taiki-e/install-action@cargo-llvm-cov
      - run: >-
          cargo llvm-cov --doc --all-features --workspace
          --lcov --output-path shard-doctests.lcov
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7
        with:
          name: coverage-shard-doctests
          path: shard-doctests.lcov
```

The doctest report lists every function in the crate, mostly with a zero count. The
join is a union, so a line the shards covered stays covered. This job runs on nightly
and the shards on stable, so the two can instrument slightly different lines of a
file; a line only one report lists is counted by that report alone, and the total
can differ a little from an all-stable run.

This job is not part of `e2e-sharded.yml`. It was checked once, locally: on a copy of
that workflow's fixture crate with one doctest added, the nextest shards alone gave
87.50% and adding this report gave 100.00%.

#### Why there is no `mode: shard`

The action has no `mode: shard` / `mode: report`. A composite action cannot own the
job matrix, the artifact hand-off, or the dependency between jobs, so such a mode
would still be two invocations inside jobs you write; it would save only the shard
job's install and partition steps. The example above is the supported shape, and
[`e2e-sharded.yml`](.github/workflows/e2e-sharded.yml) runs its shard topology. The
full reasoning, and what would change it, is in
[#24](https://github.com/action-works/omni-dev-coverage-check/issues/24).

### Fat mode with fixture setup + model-gated tests

When part of your coverage comes from suites the default `test-args` run can't
reach — `--ignored` tests that need an ML model on disk, say — keep fat mode and
add two hooks. `setup-commands` runs first under the same instrumentation env but
with profiling disabled (so a model download reuses the instrumented build yet
adds no coverage); `extra-test-commands` runs the gated suites after the main
run, and their coverage lands in the head report and the line gate:

```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/my-model            # model is cached across runs
    key: my-model-v1

- uses: action-works/omni-dev-coverage-check@v2
  with:
    setup-commands: cargo run --bin my-tool -- install-model
    extra-test-commands: |
      cargo test --all-features --test gated_inference_test -- --ignored
      cargo test --all-features --lib backends:: -- --ignored
```

The merge-base worktree recompute runs only `test-args`, not these hooks (the
gated suites/fixtures may not exist at an old fork point), and the normal path
downloads a baseline that already includes their coverage.

Both hooks are shell, evaluated in one `bash`: see
[How input values reach the scripts](#how-input-values-reach-the-scripts).

## Inputs

### patchcov install + cache

| Input                 | Description                                                                                             | Default               |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `version`             | patchcov version to install (e.g. `0.4.0`, `v0.4.0`, `latest`); leading `v`/`V` is dropped; see below | `0.4.0`               |
| `github-token`        | Token authenticating the GitHub API call that resolves `version: latest` (1000/hr vs 60/hr unauthed)   | `${{ github.token }}` |
| `use-prebuilt-binary` | Download a pre-built release binary instead of `cargo install` from source                             | `true`                |
| `cache-prefix`        | Prefix prepended to the patchcov binary cache key                                                       | `''`                  |

`version: latest` makes one call to the GitHub API to find the newest release. It sends `github-token` and tries
up to three times (waiting 3s, then 6s) when a retry can help (no answer, a timeout, a 5xx or another status that
is not a refusal, a body that is not a release), so a blip does not fail the
job and the 60-requests-an-hour limit on unauthenticated calls from a shared runner address does not either. It needs no
configuration: the token defaults to the workflow's. A refusal (401, 403 or 429: a bad token, a spent limit, which can
last up to an hour) is not retried, since asking again cannot change it. When the API gives no release, the step reads
the release from the redirect of `github.com/rust-works/patchcov/releases/latest` instead, which draws on no API quota,
and logs a warning saying so, with the API's reason. It fails only if that fails too, and the error names both. (The step reads the API's answer with `jq`, which
GitHub-hosted runners have. On a runner without it the API is not asked: the step goes straight to the redirect and
logs a warning that names `jq`, and the error, if the redirect fails too, says the API was not asked. Install `jq`
to use the API.)
A pinned `version` makes no request, and may be written as a release tag is, with a leading `v`: `v0.4.0` and
`0.4.0` give the same `version` (`0.4.0`) and `release-tag` (`v0.4.0`) outputs and share one cache entry. A
capital `V` is accepted the same way (`V0.4.0`), and `release-tag` stays lowercase. Only one leading character is
dropped, so `vv0.4.0` stays visibly wrong. A value with nothing left after that, an empty `version` or just
`v` or `V`, fails the step at once with a message naming the input, instead of failing later in a step that blames the
release: give a release number, or leave `version` out to get the default `0.4.0`.
The value goes into the step's outputs, the cache key, the download URL and `cargo install --version`, so it may hold
only letters, digits and `. + - * ^ ~ < > =` and spaces: what a release number, a pre-release (`0.4.0-rc.1`) and
the version requirements `cargo install` takes (`^0.1`, `>= 0.1`, with `use-prebuilt-binary: 'false'`) are written
with. Anything else, a newline, a `/`, a quote or a comma (the cache key cannot hold one, so a range such as
`>=0.1, <0.2` could not get past the next step anyway), fails the step at once with a message naming the input, rather than writing an extra
line into the step's outputs or steering the download to another path on github.com. Only a caller who passes a value
they do not control (a `workflow_dispatch` input, say) could reach that.
The `patchcov-cache-hit` output says whether the binary came from the cache (`true`: the download and `cargo install`
steps were skipped) or was installed (`false`). The cache key holds the runner's OS and architecture, the version and
the install method, never the action's own code; a caller that needs a fresh install on some runs can change
`cache-prefix` on those runs.

The pre-built binary is chosen from the runner's OS and architecture: Linux x64/ARM64 and
macOS x64/ARM64. Assets are named `patchcov-v<version>-<target>.tar.gz`; the binary is
inside a directory of the same name without `.tar.gz`. There is no Windows asset.
A platform with no asset, or a release with no binaries (including 0.1.0), fails with a
message naming the platform or missing asset. Set `use-prebuilt-binary: 'false'` to build
patchcov from source, or pin a release that has an asset.

The 0.4.0 Linux binaries run on Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04.
If a binary cannot start because the runner's glibc is older, the version step reports
the required and installed glibc versions and suggests a newer image or a source build.
Other loader failures retain their original diagnostics.

The default pin avoids the window between publishing a release and uploading its assets.
Explicit `version: latest` still resolves the newest tag immediately: if its assets are
not uploaded yet, rerun after the upstream release finishes or pin `0.4.0`.

### Coverage run (fat mode)

| Input              | Description                                                                                   | Default               |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `run-coverage`        | Run `cargo-llvm-cov` to produce the head report. Set `false` for thin mode                 | `true`                |
| `report`              | Path to the per-line head lcov (produced in fat mode, supplied in thin mode; with `shard-reports`, where the combined report is written) | `coverage-head.lcov`  |
| `shard-reports`       | Thin mode: the per-shard lcov reports (paths or globs, one per line) to check and combine into `report`. Requires `run-coverage: false` | `''` |
| `test-args`           | Arguments passed to `cargo test` / `cargo llvm-cov` under instrumentation. Split on whitespace only: a quote, backslash, `$` or backtick fails the step | `--all-features --workspace` |
| `setup-commands`      | Commands run under instrumentation BEFORE the test run, with profiling disabled (no coverage). Fetch fixtures the tests need (e.g. an ML model). One per line, evaluated as shell | `''` |
| `extra-test-commands` | Extra instrumented `cargo test` invocations run AFTER the main run, contributing coverage. For `--ignored`/model-gated suites `test-args` can't reach. One per line, evaluated as shell | `''` |
| `fail-under-lines`    | Overall line-coverage gate: `cargo llvm-cov report --fail-under-lines` in fat mode, `patchcov diff --fail-under-lines` in thin mode (needs an patchcov release with the flag). Empty disables it | `30`                  |
| `llvm-cov-ignore-filename-regex` | Fat mode only. ONE regex passed as `--ignore-filename-regex` to every `cargo llvm-cov report` (the lcov, `codecov.json`, the summary, the line gate, the recompute): LLVM syntax, matched against the absolute path, so write an unanchored fragment. Set `ignore-filename-regex` too. [Details](#excluding-files-ci-cannot-measure) | `''` |

### Diff / patch-coverage comment

| Input              | Description                                                                          | Default      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `base-ref`         | Base revision to diff against. Empty computes `git merge-base origin/main HEAD`       | `''`         |
| `fail-under-patch` | Patch-coverage gate (`--fail-under-patch`). Empty disables it. Enforced after comment | `''`         |
| `collapse-ranges`  | Collapse consecutive uncovered new lines into ranges (e.g. `9-11`)                    | `true`       |
| `all-files`        | Report deltas/indirect changes for ALL files, not just the diff's files              | `false`      |
| `strip-prefix`     | Override the path prefix stripped from report paths to make them repo-relative        | `''`         |
| `ignore-filename-regex` | Exclude files whose repo-relative path matches any of these regexes (comma-separated) from the head and baseline reports before the diff. [Details](#excluding-files-ci-cannot-measure) | `''` |
| `report-format`    | `auto`, `lcov`, `llvm-cov-json`, or `cobertura` (auto-detected when empty)            | `''`         |
| `comment`          | Post the rendered diff as a sticky PR comment                                         | `true`       |
| `comment-header`   | Sticky comment header (lets the comment update in place each run)                     | `coverage`   |

### Merge-base baseline

| Input                     | Description                                                                                       | Default             |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `baseline-artifact-name`  | Name of the artifact holding the per-line baseline report                                         | `coverage-baseline` |
| `baseline-workflow`       | Workflow file the baseline artifact is published from (for the merge-base download)               | `ci.yml`            |

## How the baseline works

On a pull request the action pins the comparison to the PR's fork point
(`git merge-base origin/main HEAD`), an immutable commit, so per-file deltas are
attributable to *this* PR alone rather than to whatever else merged into `main`
while the PR was open:

1. **Find** the `coverage-baseline` artifact published by the `main` run for that
   exact merge-base commit. If the merge-base has none, try its first-parent
   ancestors, nearest first, up to `baseline-ancestor-depth` of them, and use the
   first baseline found. A miss is a warning, not a failure.
2. **Download** it (`dawidd6/action-download-artifact`, by the run that was found).
3. **Recompute fallback** (fat mode): when nothing is in reach, build coverage at the
   merge-base in a git worktree and rewrite its absolute `SF:` paths to the workspace
   prefix so `patchcov diff` strips one prefix for both head and baseline.
   Use `worktree-system-deps` if building that historical commit needs system
   packages the caller lists in `worktree-system-deps`. The worktree (`../base`, and the build in it)
   is removed when the step ends, so the action can run again in the same job. If your workflow
   removes `../base` itself between two runs of the action, delete that step (or add `|| true`):
   the worktree is already gone, and `git worktree remove` fails on one that is not there.
4. **Publish** on `main` pushes: this run's lcov becomes the baseline future PRs
   download. In a sharded run that is the combined report.

Without a baseline the comment still renders patch coverage and the uncovered-line
list; only the deltas and indirect-change sections are omitted.

### What counts as a baseline

A commit has one when a **successful** run of `baseline-workflow` for it, in this
repository, holds an **unexpired** artifact named `baseline-artifact-name`. Every such
run is looked in, not only the newest, so a run that has no artifact (the
`merge_group` run of a merge queue, which shares its head SHA with the `push` run that
publishes) cannot hide the run that has it. Runs from forks are ignored.

- **Only first parents are walked.** On `main` those are the merged pull requests, each of
  which published a baseline; a second parent is a pull request's own branch, which did
  not. A shallow checkout gives a shorter walk, which is why `fetch-depth: 0` is
  required.
- **A baseline workflow that does not exist is a miss.** The API knows a workflow only
  once its file is on the default branch, so pointing `baseline-workflow` at a new
  workflow before it has merged logs a warning and carries on, instead of failing the
  step. Any other API failure (a permission, an outage) still fails the step with its
  status and message, because it says nothing about whether a baseline exists.
- **A run that is still in progress is not used**, even if it has already uploaded the
  artifact. If the `push` run for the merge-base has not finished, the next ancestor's
  baseline is used instead of rebuilding.
- **A listing that is incomplete is asked a second way.** GitHub's list of a workflow's runs,
  when filtered by commit and status, has been reported to leave out runs that match, with nothing
  in the answer to say so. A commit that has no baseline in that list is therefore looked up
  again in the workflow's latest 100 runs, listed once without a filter and matched by commit,
  conclusion and repository. It can only find a run the first list missed, and only one among
  the latest 100; an older commit's run still depends on the filtered list. If the latest runs
  cannot be listed, the filtered answer stands.
- **The log says what each commit held.** One line per commit tried: how many runs the list
  returned, how many of them were a success from this repository, and whether one held the
  artifact (and the same for what the latest runs added), so a baseline that was missed can be
  told apart from one that was never there.
- **Cost.** Each commit tried costs at least one GitHub API request, plus one for each
  successful run it has (under a merge queue that includes the queue's own run), so a lookup
  that finds nothing spends `baseline-ancestor-depth + 1` at the least. The list of the latest
  runs costs one more, once per lookup, and only when a commit had no baseline in the first.
  On github.com the workflow token allows 1,000 requests an hour per repository.

### When the baseline is an ancestor's

The deltas then compare this pull request with a baseline from a few commits before its
fork point, so they also include whatever those commits changed (usually small, and the
diff already tolerates drift). The patch is unaffected: it is still `merge-base..HEAD`.
The comment says so, on its last line:

> _Baseline: the report published for [`abc1234`](…), 2 commits before the merge-base,
> which has none. The deltas also include whatever those commits changed._

Set `baseline-ancestor-depth: 0` for the exact-merge-base lookup: a merge-base with no
baseline is then a miss, and in fat mode it is recomputed.

## Gates

Both gates run **last**, after the summary and PR comment, so the feedback still
posts when a gate fails:

- **Patch coverage** — set `fail-under-patch` to fail the build when the lines
  this PR added fall below the threshold.
- **Overall line coverage** — `fail-under-lines` (default `30`) fails the build.
  Fat mode uses `cargo llvm-cov report --fail-under-lines`; thin mode uses
  `patchcov diff --fail-under-lines`, which counts from the lcov and can
  differ slightly from llvm-cov's figure. Thin mode gates on every event, a push
  included. **If you used thin mode before this input applied to it, the default
  now gates you at 30%;** set `fail-under-lines: ''` to keep the old behaviour.

## Merge queues

If a merge queue requires the check that runs this action, add `merge_group:` to that
workflow's `on:`. A required check reports for the queue's commit only when its workflow runs
on that event; without it the pull request waits forever.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  merge_group:
```

On a `merge_group` run the action does the coverage run and the overall line gate
(`fail-under-lines`), so a drop below it ejects the pull request from the queue. It does not
post the comment, apply `fail-under-patch` or publish a baseline: those steps run on a
`pull_request`, and on a `push` to `main`. The baseline for the merged commit is published by
the `push` run after the merge. The queue's run has the same head SHA and no baseline, which the
lookup copes with (see [What counts as a baseline](#what-counts-as-a-baseline)).

The uploads have no event condition and run on the queue's commit too. With `codecov: true`
that commit is uploaded as well as the `push` run's, and because a failed upload fails the
step, a codecov outage on the queue's run ejects the pull request. To upload on the other
events only, set `codecov: ${{ github.event_name != 'merge_group' }}`.

Set the queue's group size to 1 (`max_entries_to_merge` and `min_entries_to_merge`). The
baseline lookup expects each pull request to land as one first-parent commit of `main` with a
`push` run of its own. A larger group lands several commits from one push, which runs for the
tip only, so the others would have no baseline of their own; the ancestor walk would still find
the nearest one, but the delta would then include the neighbouring pull requests' changes.

A queue also lands pull requests on `main` back to back, so a workflow-wide `concurrency` group
on `refs/heads/main` that cancels in-progress runs, or replaces a pending one, can drop the
`push` run that would have published a baseline. Give a `push` a group of its own, as this
repository's `pr-paths.yml` does:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.sha || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
```

## Excluding files CI cannot measure

Code a CI runner cannot execute (a GPU path, a backend gated to one platform) shows
near-zero coverage and reads as a regression in the comment. Two inputs drop those files,
because two programs compute coverage here and they do not read a pattern alike:

| Input                            | Filters                                                                                                                                      | Pattern                                                  |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `ignore-filename-regex`          | `patchcov diff`: the comment, the `patch-percent` / `line-percent` outputs, the patch gate and the thin-mode line gate              | Rust regexes, comma-separated, on the repo-relative path |
| `llvm-cov-ignore-filename-regex` | `cargo llvm-cov report`, fat mode only: the head lcov, `codecov.json`, the summary, the `fail-under-lines` gate and the merge-base recompute | ONE LLVM (POSIX extended) regex, on the absolute path    |

**Set both** in fat mode. For an unanchored path fragment, the usual case, the string is the
same:

```yaml
- uses: action-works/omni-dev-coverage-check@v2
  with:
    ignore-filename-regex: 'src/voice/backends/voxtral_mlx/'
    llvm-cov-ignore-filename-regex: 'src/voice/backends/voxtral_mlx/'
```

In thin mode there is no `cargo llvm-cov` in the action, so only `ignore-filename-regex`
applies and the other is ignored: filter when you build the lcov
(`cargo llvm-cov report --ignore-filename-regex ...`) if the files should also leave the
report you upload elsewhere.

### `ignore-filename-regex`: the comment, the patch gate, thin mode

- The value is a list of regexes on one line, separated by commas, each matched against
  a file's repo-relative path (after `strip-prefix`) and unanchored, so `src/gpu/`
  excludes everything under it. Only a comma separates patterns, and nothing is trimmed, so a
  newline, or a space or tab at either end or beside a comma, would become part of a pattern
  and match no path: a `|` block (which ends in a newline) or `a, b` (which looks for ` b`)
  would exclude nothing, with no warning. **The action refuses such a value** (first, before
  any install, where the value is used: on a pull request, and in thin mode with the line
  gate on) with an error that names the input: write all the patterns on ONE line with bare
  commas, as a plain or quoted value (a `|` block keeps its line breaks, and `|-` only drops
  the last one), and `[ ]` for a space that is meant. A space inside a pattern
  (`src/my dir/`) is a character of it and is allowed. A pattern cannot contain a comma
  (`a{1,3}` is split in two and fails as an invalid regex). An empty piece (`a,,b`, a
  trailing comma) is ignored, so a typo cannot exclude everything.
- The path is repo-relative, where `cargo llvm-cov --ignore-filename-regex` matches the
  absolute one: a pattern written there, such as `^/home/runner/work/…/gpu/`, matches
  nothing here, with no warning, and `^src/` written here would match nothing there.
- The files are dropped from the head **and** the baseline report before anything is
  computed, so the total, the per-file deltas, the patch coverage and the indirect
  changes all describe the same files, even when the baseline was published before the
  exclusion.
- The comment, the patch gate and the thin-mode line gate all get the filter, so a gated
  percentage is the one the comment shows, and so do the `patch-percent` and
  `line-percent` outputs, which are read from the same diff.
- A filter that removes everything is not an error, and the gates differ: if it removes
  every line a pull request adds, the patch gate has nothing to measure and passes, and
  the comment says "No new executable lines added by this diff"; if it removes every
  line of the report, the thin-mode line gate fails with "no executable lines". Check
  the comment when a pattern is broad.
- It does not reach what `cargo-llvm-cov` computes: in fat mode the `fail-under-lines`
  gate, the coverage summary, `codecov.json` and the report a push to `main` publishes as
  the baseline still count every file unless `llvm-cov-ignore-filename-regex` is set too.
- All patchcov releases support this filter.

### `llvm-cov-ignore-filename-regex`: the summary and the fat-mode gate

- Passed as `--ignore-filename-regex=<value>` to every `cargo llvm-cov report` the action
  runs: the head lcov (which is also the baseline a push to `main` publishes), `codecov.json`
  (so the codecov upload), the summary, the `fail-under-lines` gate, and the report of the
  merge-base recompute, so a recomputed baseline is filtered like the head. Empty passes
  nothing.
- It is `cargo-llvm-cov`'s own filter, so not `ignore-filename-regex`'s rules. **One** regex,
  passed as it is: a comma is part of it (`a{1,3}` is fine) and several patterns are
  joined with `|` (`src/gpu/|-sys/`). It is matched against the **absolute** path, so write a
  fragment of the path such as `src/gpu/`: `^src/gpu/` matches nothing, and the file stays in
  the summary as it was. The recompute builds in a worktree next to the workspace (`../base`),
  a different directory, so a pattern that holds the workspace's path or the checkout
  directory's name (`myrepo/src/gpu/`, or anything anchored on it) matches the head and not the
  recomputed baseline, and the comment shows those files as removed. Use a fragment from
  inside the repository.
- The syntax is LLVM's POSIX extended regex, not Rust's. **A pattern LLVM cannot compile is
  ignored silently, together with `cargo-llvm-cov`'s own default exclusions** (a `(?i)` flag,
  `(?:…)`, a lazy `.*?`, an empty alternative as in `a||b`, an unbalanced `)`): nothing fails,
  the file stays in, and files that are excluded by default, `tests/` for one, appear in the
  report. Look at the summary the first time you set it: the files should be gone and no new
  ones should have appeared.
- Setting only this one filters the head and not a baseline that was published before it was
  set, so the comment would show the files as removed. `ignore-filename-regex` filters that
  baseline when the diff is computed, which is why both are set.
- Checked on cargo-llvm-cov 0.9.1; the action installs the newest.

## How input values reach the scripts

The runner replaces every `${{ }}` in a `run:` script with its value *before* the shell
parses the script, so a value that holds shell syntax runs as shell. To keep that from
happening, no script in `action.yml` holds an expression: each input a script reads reaches
it as an environment variable and is read as `"$VAR"`, so a value cannot add a command to
the script. (It is still an argument to the tool that receives it: `base-ref`, `strip-prefix`
and the thresholds go to `git` and `patchcov` as one word each.)
`tests/check-run-expressions.sh` fails the build of this repository if an expression appears.

Four inputs are not a plain value:

- **`setup-commands` and `extra-test-commands` are shell, by design.** Each is evaluated with
  `eval` in the step's own `bash` (`-e -o pipefail`), after the instrumentation environment is
  loaded, so its lines share one shell: a variable set on one line is visible on the next, a
  failing line stops the step, and `exit` ends it. The commands run exactly as written, so
  **never wire an untrusted value into them**: a `workflow_dispatch` input, a pull-request
  title or a branch name written into either becomes a command.
- **`test-args` and `worktree-system-deps` are split into words on whitespace** (spaces, tabs
  and newlines) and nothing more: quotes are not removed, `$VAR` and `$(...)` are not expanded
  and globs are not matched. Both used to be parsed by the shell, so a value that holds a
  quote, a backslash, `$` or a backtick now **fails the step with a message** rather than
  reaching `cargo` or `apt-get` as different words from the ones written. Upgrading: write
  `test-args: --features a,b`, not `--features "a b"`; an argument that must contain a space or
  a `$` cannot go through `test-args`. `worktree-system-deps` also refuses a word that starts
  with `-`, which `apt-get` would read as an option.

## Requirements

- Check out with `fetch-depth: 0` so `git merge-base` can resolve the PR's fork point and
  the baseline lookup can walk its ancestors.
- `permissions: pull-requests: write` on the job, so the comment can be posted.
- Fat mode builds Rust under `cargo-llvm-cov`; thin mode needs only a per-line lcov.
- All flags the action uses are supported by patchcov from 0.1.0; pre-built installs
  require 0.1.1 or newer because 0.1.0 has no release assets.

## Example: pinned version, codecov upload, and a patch gate

```yaml
- uses: action-works/omni-dev-coverage-check@v2
  with:
    version: 0.4.0
    fail-under-lines: 60
    fail-under-patch: 80
    worktree-system-deps: libasound2-dev
    codecov: true
    codecov-token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```
